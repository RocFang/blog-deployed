  <p>2011早已过去，但由于长年以来都把春节作为新的一年的开始，所以现在来确定一下新学期的几个目标吧。</p>

<h2 id="一-基本目标">一.基本目标</h2>

<ol>
<li>尽快完成论文，通过答辩，顺利毕业。以期五一能有时间过个充实有意义的节日。<br /></li>
<li>坚持每天跑步，俯卧撑，其重要性无需多解释。<br /></li>
<li>减少花在寝室或教研室做无意义事情的时间。<br />
所谓无意义的事情，需要自己以旁观者的角度客观评判，例如每天阅读本是有意义且必要的，但如果在正常学习时间去阅读其他课外书，则是无意义的；看看经典的电影是有意义的，但同上，如果在正常的学习时间去看电影，则是无意义的；每天练习口琴是有意义的，但如果没有带着学习的目的去练而只是纯粹的打发时间则是无意义的；写 博客本是有意义的事情，但如果为写而写则是无意义的；等等等等&hellip;&hellip;<br /></li>
<li>坚持本博客的更新，当然，不能为写而写。<br /></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="二-扩展目标">二.扩展目标</h2>

<ol>
<li>我司专业技能培训坚持跟进，不能在起跑线上就掉后腿，时间是挤出来的。<br /></li>
<li>五一假期能旅游一下，不留遗憾。<br /></li>
<li>尽量将以前买回来的书籍看完。<br /></li>
<li>多看一些好的电影。<br /></li>
<li>深入理解布鲁斯风格吹奏。<br /></li>
</ol>

<p>暂时只想这么多，洗洗睡了。附录一篇高中时曾背过很多遍的新概念英语中的文章:New Year Resolutions新年的决心，权当怀旧。</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The New Year is a time for resolutions. Mentally, at least, most of us could compile formidable lists of ‘dos’ and ‘don&rsquo;ts’. The same old favourites recur year in year out with monotonous regularity. We resolve to get up earlier each morning, eat less, find more time to play with the children, do a thousand and one jobs about the house, be nice to people we don&rsquo;t like, drive carefully, and take the dog for a walk every day. Past experience has taught us that certain accomplishments are beyond attainment. If we remain inveterate smokers, it is only because we have so often experienced the frustration that results from failure. Most of us fail in our efforts at self-improvement because our schemes are too ambitious and we never have time to carry them out. We also make the fundamental error of announcing our resolutions to everybody so that we look even more foolish when we slip back into our bad old ways. Aware of these pitfalls, this year I attempted to keep my resolutions to myself. I limited myself to two modest ambitions: to do physical exercises every morning and to read more of an evening. An all-night party on New Year&rsquo;s Eve provided me with a good excuse for not carrying on either of these new resolutions on the first day of the year, but on the second, I applied myself assiduously to the task.</p>

<p>The daily exercises lasted only eleven minutes and I proposed to do them early in the morning before anyone had got up. The self-discipline required to drag myself out of bed eleven minutes earlier than usual was considerable. Nevertheless, I managed to creep down into the living-room for two days before anyone found me out. After jumping about on the carpet and twisting the human frame into uncomfortable positions, I sat down at the breakfast table in an exhausted condition. It was this that betrayed me. The next morning the whole family trooped in to watch the performance. That was really unsettling, but I fended off the taunts and jibes of the family good-humouredly and soon everybody got used to the idea. However, my enthusiasm waned. The time I spent at exercise gradually diminished. Little by little the eleven minutes fell to zero. By January 10th, I was back to where I had started from. I argued that if I spent less time exhausting myself at exercises in the morning, I would keep my mind fresh for reading when I got home from work. Resisting the hypnotizing effect of television, I sat in my room for a few evenings with my eyes glued to a book. One night, however, feeling cold and lonely, I went downstairs and sat in front of the television pretending to read. That proved to be my undoing, for I soon got back to my old bad habit of dozing off in front of the screen. I still haven&rsquo;t given up my resolution to do more reading. In fact, I have just bought a book entitled How to Read a Thousand Words a Minute. Perhaps it will solve my problem, but I just haven&rsquo;t had time to read it!</p>
